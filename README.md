This is a small program I made in C to track my study habits. I noticed sometimes I study a lot but still struggle with some subjects so I wanted to see how consistent I really am.

You can add your daily study time, difficulty, and focus for each subject. The program will give you a simple score and tell you which subjects you are spending too little or too much time on.

I wrote this codw to practice C and to understand my own study patterns. It helped me figure out where I need to focus more and stay consistent.

TECHNIQUES USED:
I used structures to organize daily study records, arrays to store multiple entries, functions to keep the code organized, loops and conditionals 
for calculations and analysis and file handling to save data.
