STUDY HABIT ANALYZER
When I started my preperation for SAT I found it difficult to track my performance as I had to focus on two main sections maths and english. 
One day, I  came up with the idea of using my C language skills to develop a  program called Study Habit Analyzer. I learnt the basics pf C lanuage in 10th grade and then developed a stronger command of C during 12th grade. Now i used them practically to build this program using 
some basic concepts to strenghthen my knowledge .
