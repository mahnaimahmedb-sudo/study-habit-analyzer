STUDY HABIT ANALYZER:
When I started my preperation for SAT I found it difficult to track my performance as I had to focus on two main sections maths and english. 
One day, I  came up with the idea of using my C language skills to develop a  program called Study Habit Analyzer. I learnt the basics pf C lanuage in 10th grade and then developed a stronger command of C during 12th grade. Now i used them practically to build this program using 
some basic concepts to strenghthen my knowledge .
TECHNIQUE USED:
The stdio.h header file is used at the beginning of pragrsm which is used for input and output operations. 
after that in the body of the program the int,char data types are used for variable declaration and initializaion
the main logic that is used in this program is loops : while ,do while lopps are used for the further processing
then conditional statements like if and switch  are used for error checking and menu selection . all of these commamnds 
helped in the execution of the program.
HOW TO USE:

First we give the input of subject, time studied,and difficulty level of the subject we wannt to track the consistency of after that the program logic is applied on the 
given information and analyze it to execute the result accordingly.

here is the clear example of the program calculating the given input and executing the result based on the input.
